  const faqs = [
    {
      question: "Why do newer homes in Moreno Valley have drain problems?",
      answer: "Moreno Valley has experienced rapid residential development over recent decades, with extensive tract housing throughout Sunnymead Ranch, Rancho Belago, Towngate, and Moreno Valley Ranch. Newer homes can experience drain issues for several reasons. Construction debris like concrete, drywall, or grout sometimes enters drain lines during building. Post-construction soil settlement can shift drain pipes, creating low spots where debris accumulates. Landscaping installation may disturb drainage systems. Additionally, new homeowners may not yet understand their plumbing system's limitations. We specialize in addressing these new-construction-specific issues throughout Moreno Valley's developments."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you coordinate drain service with my builder's warranty?",
      answer: "Yes, we regularly work with builders and warranty departments for Moreno Valley's numerous residential developments. When drain problems occur during your warranty period, we can provide detailed video camera inspections and documentation that identifies whether issues result from defects, improper installation, or normal usage. This documentation helps support warranty claims when appropriate. We communicate directly with builders and warranty administrators, providing technical information they need to process claims. Our experience with Moreno Valley's major developers and tract builders streamlines this coordination process."
    },
    {
      question: "What preventive drain care should new Moreno Valley homeowners practice?",
      answer: "New homeowners in Moreno Valley's developments should establish good habits immediately. Avoid putting construction debris, paint, or renovation materials down drains during move-in. Don't treat drains like trash cans even in new homes. Be cautious during landscaping installation to avoid damaging buried drain lines. Schedule a professional camera inspection after your first year to verify everything installed correctly and identify any construction debris that entered lines. Consider annual preventive cleaning, especially if you have large families or frequent guests. Establishing these practices early prevents problems that commonly emerge in years two through five of new home ownership."
    },
    {
      question: "Do different Moreno Valley developments have different plumbing systems?",
      answer: "Yes, Moreno Valley's extensive development spans several decades, and plumbing materials and methods have evolved. Older developments in areas like Sunnymead may have different pipe materials than newer tracts in Moreno Valley Ranch or Towngate. Some communities feature HOA-maintained systems while others are fully private. Lot sizes vary significantly across developments, affecting drain line lengths and configurations. Our technicians are familiar with the specific characteristics of major Moreno Valley developments and adjust our approach accordingly. We keep records of different tract specifications to provide more efficient service."
    },
    {
      question: "Can problems with irrigation systems affect my drains?",
      answer: "Absolutely, and this is particularly relevant in Moreno Valley where many newer homes feature extensive landscaping and irrigation systems. Irrigation line breaks can saturate soil around drain pipes, causing settling or washout that stresses the drainage system. Tree and shrub roots stimulated by irrigation often invade nearby sewer lines seeking water. Improper irrigation installation may damage buried drain pipes. We've seen cases where irrigation runoff overwhelms outdoor drains or where irrigation boxes were mistakenly connected to sewer systems. When diagnosing persistent drainage issues, we often recommend checking irrigation systems as potential contributing factors."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide drain inspection services for home purchases?",
      answer: "Yes, pre-purchase drain inspections are particularly valuable in Moreno Valley's active real estate market. Even in newer homes, our video camera inspections can reveal construction defects, improper installations, or hidden problems before you complete your purchase. We provide detailed reports with video documentation that you can share with sellers or use to negotiate repairs. For homes in older Moreno Valley developments, inspections identify aging infrastructure that may need attention soon. Many Moreno Valley homebuyers include our inspection services in their due diligence process, giving them confidence in their investment and negotiating power when issues surface."

              Professional Drain Cleaning Services for Moreno Valley Homes

              <p>
                Moreno Valley represents one of Riverside County's fastest-growing cities, with extensive residential development transforming the landscape over recent decades. Neighborhoods like Sunnymead Ranch, Rancho Belago, Towngate, Box Springs, and Moreno Valley Ranch feature predominantly newer construction with modern plumbing systems that differ significantly from older Inland Empire communities. Gardner Plumbing Company has grown alongside Moreno Valley, developing specialized expertise in the unique drainage challenges these newer developments present. From construction debris in recently completed homes to soil settlement issues in established tracts, we understand the specific problems Moreno Valley homeowners face.
              </p>
              <p>
                The rapid development that characterizes Moreno Valley creates distinctive drain service needs. New construction sometimes leaves debris in drain lines that surfaces months or years after completion. Post-construction soil settlement can shift pipes, creating drainage problems that weren't present initially. Landscaping installation and irrigation systems added after home completion may impact drainage infrastructure. Our technicians are thoroughly familiar with these new-development issues and provide <Link href="/services/drain-cleaning" className="text-red-400 hover:text-red-300 underline">specialized drain cleaning services</Link> that address construction-related problems other companies may not recognize. We also coordinate with builders and warranty departments when drain issues fall within coverage periods.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreno Valley's newer plumbing systems typically feature PVC drain lines that respond well to modern cleaning technology. Our <Link href="/services/hydro-jetting" className="text-red-400 hover:text-red-300 underline">professional hydro-jetting equipment</Link> thoroughly scours these pipes clean without the damage concerns that older pipe materials present. Video camera inspections verify proper installation and identify any construction defects or debris accumulation. For newer homeowners unfamiliar with their plumbing systems, we provide education about proper drain care and maintenance schedules that prevent future problems. Our preventive approach helps Moreno Valley families avoid the costly emergency repairs that often result from neglected maintenance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Emergency drain situations require immediate professional response whether you live in Sunnymead Ranch, Towngate, or any Moreno Valley neighborhood. A backed-up sewer line doesn't wait for convenient timing, and DIY attempts often worsen problems in newer plumbing systems where homeowners lack experience. Our <Link href="/services/emergency-service" className="text-red-400 hover:text-red-300 underline">24/7 emergency drain service</Link> covers all Moreno Valley developments with rapid response and complete equipment. When camera inspection reveals damaged pipes requiring replacement beyond cleaning, we provide comprehensive <Link href="/services/sewer-and-septic" className="text-red-400 hover:text-red-300 underline">sewer line repair and replacement</Link> services.
