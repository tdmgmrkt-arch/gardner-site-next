    question:
      "What is the difference between a furnace tune-up and an HVAC maintenance plan?",
    answer: (
      <>
        A furnace tune-up is a single annual visit focused on your furnace — one
        service call, one invoice. That&apos;s it. An HVAC maintenance plan is
        an ongoing service agreement covering both your heating and cooling
        systems under one contract. You enroll once, and we schedule two visits
        per year going forward — spring AC service and fall furnace service —
        with priority scheduling and repair discounts applied automatically. A
        tune-up is the right choice if you want your furnace serviced this year.
        An HVAC maintenance plan is the right choice if you want both systems
        covered year-round without scheduling separately. See our{" "}

        for full details.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I get a furnace tune-up in Murrieta?",
    answer:
      "Once per year, in the fall. The Inland Empire heating season runs November through March — a tune-up in September or October catches issues before the first cold stretch. Furnaces that sit idle all summer accumulate dust on burner ports and sensors. Skipping tune-ups for two or more consecutive seasons significantly increases the likelihood of a mid-season no-heat call.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does a furnace tune-up cost in Murrieta?",
    answer:
      "A standard furnace tune-up in Murrieta ranges from $89 to $149 depending on system age and access conditions. That price includes the safety inspection, combustion analysis, burner cleaning, igniter test, and flame sensor cleaning. If a repair is needed — igniter replacement, gas valve adjustment — we quote that separately before proceeding. Annual maintenance is significantly cheaper than an emergency repair call in December.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will a furnace tune-up catch a cracked heat exchanger?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A combustion analysis and visual heat exchanger inspection are included in every tune-up. A cracked exchanger allows combustion gases — including carbon monoxide — to mix with heated air. A CO leak is odorless and colorless; a combustion analyzer detects it when visual inspection alone might miss a small crack. If we find a crack, we advise you of the safety risk and your options before leaving.",
  },
  {
    question: "My furnace ran fine last winter — do I still need a tune-up?",
    answer:
      "A furnace that ran well last season can still have a degraded igniter, growing scale on the burner ports, or a developing crack in the heat exchanger. These don't announce themselves — they accumulate quietly over summer and then fail in November. A tune-up is preventive maintenance, not a repair visit. If the inspection finds nothing wrong, you pay the flat tune-up fee and have confidence going into winter. If it finds something, you caught it before it became a no-heat emergency.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I do if my furnace breaks down after a tune-up?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Call us. If a part that was inspected during the tune-up fails within 30
        days, our technicians return at no additional diagnostic fee. Furnace
        repairs found on inspection are quoted and approved before work begins.

              A furnace tune-up is a single-visit annual service for your
              furnace — not a service contract, not a subscription. You schedule
              it once a year, we inspect and service your heating system, and
              you&apos;re done. Inland Empire homeowners who get a tune-up every
              fall avoid the most common no-heat calls. View{" "}

                A furnace tune-up is preventive — scheduled when it&apos;s
                convenient, not when it&apos;s critical. But if your furnace
                hasn&apos;t been serviced in two or more years and you&apos;re
                heading into November, urgency increases. A system that
                hasn&apos;t been inspected in multiple seasons is a no-heat call
                waiting to happen. Schedule now before slots fill.
