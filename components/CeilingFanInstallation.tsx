Technician is wearing a light gray button-up work shirt with a red Gardner Plumbing Co. patch on the left chest, navy work pants, dark navy ball cap with red Gardner logo, black work boots, red Milwaukee tool bag on hip. Fan motor housing already mounted to ceiling box, one blade being fastened in hand, screwdriver visible. Warm interior LED light blending with afternoon daylight through a window. Calm, mid-task posture — not posed. 50mm equivalent lens, shallow depth of field. Cinematic realism, documentary photography style. Style and likeness of attached reference image.";

LEFT HALF: bare ceiling electrical box with a simple dome light fixture attached, outdated brass trim ring, soft single-bulb light below, neutral room light. RIGHT HALF: same ceiling location after installation — modern brushed-nickel ceiling fan with four blades and an integrated LED light kit mounted cleanly, fan blade span filling the frame, warm light kit glowing below. Seamless lighting match across both halves, straight-on 35mm lens, no people, no hands, technical documentation style. Smooth white ceiling background.";

    question: "How much does ceiling fan installation cost in Murrieta?",
    answer:
      "Replacing an existing ceiling fan on an already-wired location runs $100–$175 in labor, plus the cost of the fan itself. New installation where there's no existing junction box — including running a switch leg — typically costs $200–$350 depending on ceiling height and access. Smart fans with app or voice control add $25–$50 for wiring verification and setup time. We provide written pricing before starting so you know the total before we pick up a tool.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a ceiling fan be installed where there's no existing wiring?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes, but it requires more work than a simple replacement. Our
        electricians install a fan-rated junction box, run a switch leg from the
        nearest switch location, and connect the circuit. In most Murrieta homes
        with attic access, this is a half-day job. Concrete or flat ceilings
        without attic access take longer. The job also pairs naturally with{" "}

      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is a fan-rated junction box and why does it matter?",
    answer:
      "A standard light fixture box is designed for static weight — it cannot handle the rotation and torque of a spinning ceiling fan. A fan-rated box is braced differently and rated for the dynamic load a fan produces. Installing a ceiling fan on a non-fan-rated box is a code violation and creates a real risk of the fan pulling loose from the ceiling. Our electricians always verify the box rating before mounting a fan.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I control my ceiling fan and light separately?",
    answer:
      "Yes, through two separate wall switches or a remote receiver kit. A two-switch setup requires two conductors in the switch leg — many older Inland Empire homes have only a single conductor, which means the fan and light share one switch. Our electricians assess your existing wiring and give you the options before installation. Alternatively, a smart fan with a wireless receiver splits fan and light control without additional wiring runs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do outdoor ceiling fans need a special circuit in California?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes. California code and the NEC require GFCI protection on any outdoor
        receptacle or fixture circuit. Outdoor and covered patio fans must also
        be rated as &quot;damp&quot; (covered patio, not exposed to direct rain)
        or &quot;wet&quot; (fully exposed). Installing an indoor-rated fan
        outdoors voids the warranty and creates a shock and fire risk. Our
        electricians install the correct fan rating with a GFCI-protected circuit
        — especially important for covered patios in Murrieta and Temecula where
        outdoor living rooms are common. See our{" "}

  },
  {
    question: "How much can a ceiling fan actually reduce my cooling costs?",
    answer: (
      <>
        The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that running ceiling fans on
        high while raising the thermostat 4°F produces the same comfort level —
        and can cut cooling costs 4–8% per degree raised on the thermostat. In
        an Inland Empire summer where AC runs 8–10 hours a day, that adds up.
        Ceiling fans don&apos;t cool the air — they cool people by moving air
        across skin. Turn them off when you leave the room. If your AC is
        underperforming regardless, our{" "}

              Inland Empire summers regularly push past 100°F. A properly
              installed ceiling fan can make a room feel 4–6 degrees cooler,
              cutting AC run time and electric bills through the hottest months.
              Our electricians handle every scenario — fan replacements on
              existing fixtures, new installs where there&apos;s no junction box,
              smart fans, and outdoor fans for patios. View{" "}

                A fan that sparks, wobbles dangerously at the ceiling, or causes
                a breaker to trip is not a routine replacement call. These signs

                attention. Our line is live around the clock — don&apos;t run a
