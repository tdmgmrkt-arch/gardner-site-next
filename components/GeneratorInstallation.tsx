  "Photo of an electrician making the electrical hookup at a transfer switch panel mounted beside a standby generator outside an Inland Empire home, medium shot showing the tech and the equipment. Technician is wearing a light gray button-up work shirt with a red Gardner Plumbing Co. patch on the left chest, navy work pants, dark navy ball cap with red Gardner logo, black work boots, red Milwaukee tool bag on hip. Transfer switch enclosure open, multi-conductor conduit running between transfer switch and house meter, non-contact tester in hand — electrical connection work is the focus, not the generator brand. Midday SoCal directional sunlight, desert-dry landscaping in background. Focused, mid-task. 50mm equivalent lens, shallow depth of field. Cinematic realism, documentary photography style. Style and likeness of attached reference image.";

  {
    question: "What does a generator installation electrician actually do?",
    answer:
      "Our scope is the electrical connection between the generator and your home's circuits — not the generator itself. Specifically: we install the transfer switch (manual or automatic) that safely disconnects your home from SCE's grid when the generator is running, run the wiring from the transfer switch to selected critical circuits, and install the inlet box or ATS connection point where the generator plugs in. We also coordinate the permit process on your behalf (permit fees are listed as a pass-through line on your quote). What we do not do: recommend which generator to buy, deliver or set up the generator unit, supply fuel, or service the generator engine. That side belongs to the generator dealer or a qualified service tech.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a transfer switch and why is it required?",
    answer:
      "A transfer switch is the device that disconnects your home from SoCal Edison's grid before your generator starts powering your circuits. Without it, generator power can flow backward through your meter onto utility lines — a condition called back-feed. Back-feed has killed utility workers responding to outages, and it can cause fires if the grid restores power while your generator is running. NEC Article 702 (Optional Standby Systems) requires a proper disconnecting means for all generator hookups. The City of Murrieta enforces this requirement through permits and inspections. Running a generator with extension cords through windows bypasses all of this — it is unsafe and it is a code violation. Every hookup we install includes a compliant transfer switch or interlock kit.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Do I need a generator to keep my HVAC running during an outage?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes — if your home has a heat pump or central air conditioning system,
        those systems are entirely electrical and stop working the moment the grid
        goes down. In an Inland Empire summer, losing AC during a PSPS event is a
        health concern, not just a comfort issue. Heat pumps, in particular, have
        no gas backup — if the grid is down, the home has no heating or cooling
        unless a generator is powering the HVAC circuit. A properly sized standby
        generator with the HVAC circuit on the transfer switch keeps your{" "}

    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between a standby generator and a portable generator hookup?",
    answer:
      "A standby generator is a permanently installed unit — mounted outside the home on a pad, connected to a fuel supply, and wired through an automatic transfer switch. It detects grid loss and starts automatically. Most standby units run on natural gas or propane. A portable generator is a wheeled unit stored until needed, started manually, and connected through an inlet box and transfer switch or interlock kit. Both require proper electrical hookup — the difference is in how the generator is deployed, not in whether a transfer switch is needed. Portable hookups are lower cost to install; standby systems are more convenient. Our electricians install the electrical side of both — see the service cards above for scope details.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does generator hookup require a permit in Murrieta?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Generator hookup — whether standby or portable inlet box — is a permit-required electrical project in Murrieta and throughout Riverside County. The permit triggers a city inspection that confirms the transfer switch, disconnect, and wiring meet NEC 702. Unpermitted generator hookups are a liability issue: they void the electrical portion of your homeowner's insurance and put you at risk if a back-feed event damages utility equipment. Permits are the homeowner's responsibility under California law; we can coordinate the paperwork on your behalf — permit fees are listed as a pass-through line on your quote. Permit processing in Murrieta typically takes 3 to 7 business days.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does generator electrical hookup cost in Murrieta?",
    answer: (
      <>
        A portable generator inlet box with interlock kit — the most common
        entry-level hookup — typically runs $800 to $1,500, permit and inspection
        included. A manual transfer switch with selected critical circuits runs
        $1,500 to $3,000 depending on the number of circuits included. An
        automatic transfer switch (ATS) for a whole-home standby generator runs
        $2,500 to $5,000 for the electrical work, not including the generator unit
        itself. All quotes are written before work begins. If the hookup also

              SoCal Edison&apos;s Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) program has
              cut power to parts of Riverside County multiple times in recent
              years — typically during high-wind events when fire risk peaks.
              Summer heat demand also strains the IE grid. Homeowners who have a
              standby or portable generator but no proper transfer switch are
              running an unsafe setup — and potentially back-feeding power onto
              utility lines. Our electricians handle the electrical side of
              generator installation: transfer switch, load management, sub-panel
              integration, and permit. View our{" "}

                SCE PSPS events in the Inland Empire are seasonal — they happen in
                fall and early winter when Santa Ana winds peak. Homeowners who
                call after the outage starts cannot get a code-compliant hookup
                permitted and inspected during the outage. Our electricians
                schedule generator hookup installations year-round — before
                outage season is the right time to call.
