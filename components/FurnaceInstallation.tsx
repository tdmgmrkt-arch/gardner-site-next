    question: "How do I know when to replace rather than repair my furnace?",
    answer: (
      <>
        If your furnace is over 15 years old and facing a repair that costs more
        than a third of a new unit&apos;s price, replacement typically makes
        more financial sense. A furnace over 20 years old is beyond its designed
        service life regardless of repair cost. Multiple failures in the same
        season — igniter, gas valve, and heat exchanger in one winter — are also
        a strong replacement signal. If you&apos;re not sure, we give you both
        numbers and let you decide. If repair still makes sense, see our{" "}

    ),
  },
  {
    question: "What size furnace does my Inland Empire home need?",
    answer:
      "Sizing depends on your home's square footage, insulation quality, number and size of windows, ceiling height, and local climate. A furnace that's too large short-cycles — burning fuel without completing a full heat cycle. One that's too small runs constantly and still can't reach setpoint on cold nights. Our technicians perform a Manual J load calculation before recommending any unit. Inland Empire homes typically fall in the 40,000–80,000 BTU range depending on size and construction vintage.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does furnace installation cost in Murrieta?",
    answer: (
      <>
        A standard gas furnace installation in Murrieta typically ranges from
        $2,500 to $5,500 depending on unit efficiency (80% vs. 96% AFUE), brand,
        home size, and whether new flue venting or gas line work is required.
        Electric furnace installations are generally on the lower end of that
        range. We provide a written itemized quote — equipment, labor, permit,
        and haul-away — before any work starts. Financing is available for
        qualified homeowners through our{" "}

    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Should I get a gas furnace or a heat pump?",
    answer: (
      <>
        For most Inland Empire homes with existing gas service, a high-efficiency
        gas furnace is the straightforward replacement. Heat pumps make the most
        sense if you want to eliminate a gas bill, if you need cooling as well as
        heating, or if you&apos;re replacing both systems at once. IE winters are
        mild enough that a heat pump handles heating efficiently without auxiliary
        strips kicking in constantly. Our{" "}

    ),

  {
    question: "Do I need a permit for furnace installation in Murrieta?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The City of Murrieta requires a mechanical permit for HVAC equipment installation, including furnace replacement. Our team pulls the permit before work begins and coordinates the final inspection with the city. Do not use a contractor who skips the permit — an unpermitted system can void your homeowner's insurance, complicate a home sale, and leave you without a code-compliant installation. Permit fees are included in our upfront written quote.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does furnace installation take?",
    answer: (
      <>
        A standard furnace replacement — removing the old unit, installing the
        new one, connecting gas and electrical, and commissioning — takes 4–6
        hours in most Inland Empire homes. A first-time installation with new gas
        line work or complex venting can run 6–8 hours. We don&apos;t rush
        commissioning. The system is run-tested through a full heat cycle before
        the technician leaves, and you receive all equipment documentation and
        warranty registration information. Protect your new system with{" "}

              Most Inland Empire homes run their furnaces fewer than 100 days a
              year — but those days matter. A furnace that&apos;s the wrong size
              wastes energy on mild days and can&apos;t keep up when temperatures
              drop into the 30s in Hemet or Menifee. Our technicians perform a
              proper load calculation before selecting any unit, so the system
              fits your home. View{" "}

                Some furnace failures are not repairable — a condemned heat
                exchanger, a failed heat block, or a unit that&apos;s simply
                beyond its service life. When repair is not safe or economical,
                we move to replacement quickly. Same-week installation scheduling
                is available for households without heat going into a cold
                stretch.
