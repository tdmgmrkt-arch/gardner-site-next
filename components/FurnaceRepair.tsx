    question: "How do I know if my furnace needs repair or full replacement?",
    answer: (
      <>
        If your furnace is under 15 years old and the repair cost is less than
        half the price of a new unit, repair is almost always the right call.
        Furnaces over 20 years old — especially those with a cracked heat
        exchanger or repeated igniter failures in the same season — are usually
        better candidates for replacement. Our technicians give you both numbers
        upfront. For replacement options, see our{" "}

      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question:
      "What are the most common furnace problems in Inland Empire homes?",
    answer:
      "The three failures we see most often across Murrieta, Temecula, and Menifee are: failed hot surface igniters, dirty or faulty flame sensors, and clogged or misaligned burners. IE homes tend to run furnaces infrequently — months of inactivity let dust and debris accumulate on burner ports and sensors. A furnace that clicks but won't light, or lights then shuts off after 30 seconds, is usually dealing with one of these three issues.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is a cracked heat exchanger dangerous?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A cracked heat exchanger allows combustion gases — including carbon monoxide — to mix with the heated air circulating through your home. CO is odorless and colorless. If our technician identifies a crack during inspection, the furnace cannot be safely operated until the exchanger is replaced or the unit is replaced entirely. We perform combustion analysis on every furnace repair call to rule this out. If your CO detector is going off alongside furnace problems, call immediately.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does my furnace keep shutting off after a few minutes?",
    answer:
      "Short cycling — where the furnace ignites and then shuts off before completing a full heat cycle — is usually caused by a dirty flame sensor, a clogged filter restricting airflow, or an overheating heat exchanger triggering the high-limit switch. Check your filter first. If the filter is clean and the problem continues, the flame sensor likely needs cleaning or replacement. A technician can diagnose and fix this in under an hour in most cases.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How often should I schedule furnace maintenance to avoid repairs?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Once per year, ideally in late September or early October — before the
        first cold snap. An annual furnace tune-up catches worn igniters, dirty
        burners, and small cracks before they cause a no-heat call in December.
        IE homeowners who skip maintenance for 3 or more years see significantly
        higher repair rates. Our{" "}

    question:

We maintain a dedicated 24/7 emergency line at (951) 246-4337. Households with elderly residents, infants, or medical equipment that requires heat — mention that when you call.

                Some furnace failures cannot wait until morning. A cracked heat
                exchanger, a system that won&apos;t ignite at all, or complete
                heat loss during a cold Murrieta night are situations that need
                same-day attention. Carbon monoxide risk makes heat exchanger
                failures especially urgent. Our emergency line is live 24 hours
                a day, 7 days a week.
